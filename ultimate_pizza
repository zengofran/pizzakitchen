###**Ingredients**

- 1 3/4 cups warm about 110ÂºF water
- 1 package 2 1/4 tsp active dry yeast
- 1 tsp granulated sugar
- 1/4 cup olive oil plus more for bowl
- 1 1/2 tsp coarse salt
- 19.5 oz (4 1/3 cups lightly spooned into measuring cup and levelled off) bread flour or all-purpose flour

###**Toppings**
- Tomatoes
- Cheese




###**Instructions**
1. Combine water, yeast and sugar in bowl of stand mixer and let stand 10 minutes to proof. Yeast should be dissolved and frothy. Add oil and salt.
2. Attach dough hook to mixer and turn it on low speed. Slowly add about half of the flour, mixing until it forms a sticky dough. Add remainder of dough a bit at a time until it forms a smooth ball. It'll still be tacky to touch, but won't stick to the sides of the bowl. Let mixer knead the dough on low speed for five minutes.
3. Lightly oil the bowl and the dough (I just splash a glug of oil and roll the dough all around and up the sides of the bowl to grease the whole thing). Cover and let rise for 1 1/2 hours, until doubled in size.
4. Meanwhile, prepare all of your toppings.
5. When dough has risen, preheat a large cast-iron pan on high heat for five minutes. Turn on your broiler (with convection turned on if you have it). Set out large baking sheets.
6. Divide dough into 8 pieces and roll each into a ball. On a lightly floured counter, roll each ball into a circle of desired crust thinness. Transfer first pizza dough round to hot cast iron pan. When bubbles form and bottom is nicely browned, about 60 seconds, lift it out with a spatula and place on a baking sheet. (If your oven doesn't offer a convection setting on broil, flip the dough over and let it cook for 30 seconds on the other side, too to make sure it'll be cooked through.) Repeat with remaining crusts.
7. Arrange toppings on pizza crusts and broil until toppings are bubbly and edge of crust is charred in spots (about 5 minutes, but watch carefully and don't walk away).
